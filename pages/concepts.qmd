-   What are the major benefits of using R projects?

> The major benefits of using R projects is that they provide an intuitive way to separate work into different organized groups. Within each group is its own working directory, folder structure, etc. It also simplifies the sharing of R code to others for contributions.

-   What are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?

> The tibble is a reimagining of the data frame. The two main differences is that a tibble does less and is more temperamental, meaning that working with them tends to encourage more expressive code. 

-   Rewrite the following nested function call using BaseRâ€™s chaining operator:
arrange(filter(select(as_tibble(iris), starts_with("Petal"), Species), Petal.Length < 1.55), Species)

> as_tibble(iris) |>
  select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) |>
  filter(Petal.Length < 1.55) |>
  arrange(Species)
  
> as a chunk:

```{r}
as_tibble(iris) |>
  select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) |>
  filter(Petal.Length < 1.55) |>
  arrange(Species)
```
